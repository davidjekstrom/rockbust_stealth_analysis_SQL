## Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis
In this project, i've used SQL to clean, merg and analyze revenue data for Rockbuster Stealth's business in order to provide insights and recommendations as they move toward a subscription streaming model.


## Project overview
### Background
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that is transitioning from having brick & mortar stores to being an online rental service by using use its existing movie licenses.

As a business intelligence analyst, you're goal is to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service by consolidating and querying data on Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments and providing insights and answering any questions the business may have. You will compile the results of my analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

### Key Business Questions
Here are the main questions the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board needs to answer to help drive their 2020 business strategy:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

### Context
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL to answer increasingly complex business questions for each task. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.
